🛡️ DeFi is a dark forest, but you don't have to walk it alone.

Introducing **GuardianClaw** — the first AI-Powered Transaction Firewall for @BNBCHAIN. 

Protect your wallet from honeypots, rug pulls, and malicious drains in real-time. 🧵👇 #BNBChain #opBNB #Web3Security

**Tweet 2: The Logic**
Why GuardianClaw? 
Existing tools tell you *after* you've been scammed. We block it *before* it happens.

Combining AI-driven risk assessment with on-chain PolicyGuard enforcement. Non-custodial. Immutable. Instant. ⚡

**Tweet 3: The Tech**
Built on @opBNB_Network for speed and efficiency.
Every time we block a threat, an AuditNFT is minted on-chain—providing verifiable Proof-of-Action for your security history. 📋💎

**Tweet 4: The Agent**
Our OpenClaw AI Agent scans:
✅ Honeypot Bytecode
✅ Liquidity Depth
✅ Ownership Risks
✅ Approval Scams

Total protection for the BNB ecosystem. 🤖🛡️

**Headline**: Why AI is the Future of Non-Custodial Security on BNB Chain.

**Body**: 
At GuardianClaw, we believe security shouldn't be a trade-off for speed. Working on the @BNBChain ecosystem, we’ve developed a transaction firewall that uses real-time AI agents to analyze smart contract risks before a user ever signs.

Key Innovations:
1. **PolicyGuard**: A smart contract logic layer that enforces user-defined security rules.
2. **AuditNFTs**: Bridging the gap between off-chain AI decisions and on-chain accountability.
3. **Open Access**: Modular detectors that the community can improve and fork.

Proud to showcase this project for the #BNBChainAIDP Hackathon!
