---

## 🎬 Scene 1: The Problem (0:00 - 0:45)
**Visual**: Fast-paced montage of news headlines about honeypots, rug pulls, and wallet drains on BSC.
**Speaker**: 
> "DeFi on BNB Chain is faster and cheaper than ever, but that speed comes at a price. Every day, thousands of users fall victim to honeypots, malicious signatures, and rug pulls. Current security tools are either too slow, requiring manual research, or too complex for the average user. Your wallet is a fortress, but the bridge to the blockchain—your transactions—is wide open. Until now."

## 🎬 Scene 2: The Solution (0:45 - 1:30)
**Visual**: GuardianClaw logo animation. Soft transition to the high-end Dashboard UI.
**Speaker**: 
> "Introducing GuardianClaw. The first AI-powered, non-custodial transaction firewall built for the BNB Chain ecosystem. GuardianClaw doesn't just watch your wallet; it guards every single outgoing interaction. By combining local policy enforcement with a real-time AI risk engine, we block malicious attempts before they ever hit the mempool."

## 🎬 Scene 3: How it Works (1:30 - 2:30)
**Visual**: Screen recording of the 'Send & Scan' flow. Agent scanning animation (rotating shield).
**Speaker**: 
> "It’s simple. Connect your Guardian Wallet. When you initiate a transaction, our OpenClaw AGENT performs a multi-layer analysis. It checks for honeypot bytecode, liquidity depth, ownership risks, and suspicious approval patterns.
> 
> Within milliseconds, the agent provides a signed risk assessment. If a threat is detected, our on-chain PolicyGuard instantly reverts the transaction. Your funds never leave your control, and every intervention is minted as an AuditNFT on opBNB—giving you an immutable, verifiable proof-of-protection."

## 🎬 Scene 4: The Vision & Future (2:30 - 3:00)
**Visual**: Metrics slide (37 tests passed, 92% detection) + opBNB/BSC Testnet explorer links.
**Speaker**: 
> "GuardianClaw is more than a tool; it's a security standard. Built on opBNB for ultra-low latency and near-zero fees, we ensure that security doesn't slow you down. We're open-sourcing our detector modules to build a global community of security intelligence. 
> 
> Join us in making BNB Chain the safest place to build and trade. GuardianClaw. Your AI Shield in the DeFi Wild."

## 💡 Key Talking Points for Judges
1. **Non-Custodial First**: We never see your private keys. The agent only provides attestations.
2. **On-Chain Enforcement**: Security isn't just a UI warning; it's a smart contract mandate.
3. **Audit Trail**: Every block is an NFT. This enables future insurance products and trust scores.
4. **Developer Ready**: Our detectors are modular. Any project can integrate the OpenClaw API.
